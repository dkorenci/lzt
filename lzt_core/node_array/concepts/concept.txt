These interfaces are provided as a precise description of
methods and typedefs that NodeArray and Node types have to define.
Interfaces are not supposed to be inherited by implementations of
NodeArray and Node concepts. This polymorphic approach would lead to
performance degradations caused by invocation of virtual methods.
